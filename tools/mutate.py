"""Measure whether a demo's test suite actually catches bugs in the demo.

A suite that reimplements the mechanism inline stays green no matter what
happens to the code it claims to test. That is not hypothetical here: this
collection once had 63 demos that did not run at all while every suite reported
100% passing. The smoke check in run-tests.sh catches "does not run"; nothing
catches "runs, but is wrong".

This does. For each demo it makes a small, deliberate change to the demo's real
scripts — flip a comparison, negate a constant, swap and/or — and re-runs only
the logic suite. If the suite still passes, that mutation SURVIVED: nothing in
the suite depends on the mutated behaviour.

    tools/mutate.py                    # every demo
    tools/mutate.py state-machine      # one or more
    tools/mutate.py --limit 3          # mutations per demo (default 5)
    tools/mutate.py --json report.json # machine-readable output

A score of 0% killed means the suite is testing a copy of the logic rather than
the logic. 100% means every change it tried was noticed.

Scripts are restored after every run, including on Ctrl-C.

# --- Crash safety -----------------------------------------------------------

# This tool edits the demos in place and restores them afterwards. A `finally`
# block is not enough: a SIGKILL, an OOM kill, or a terminal that goes away
# leaves the mutation on disk. That is not hypothetical — it happened, the
# leftover was committed by a blanket `git add -A`, and the resulting infinite
# recursion in quadtree produced the 40GB output that caused the OOM crashes in
# the first place.
#
# So every mutation is journalled to disk before it is applied. Any later run
# restores whatever a previous run left behind before doing anything else.
