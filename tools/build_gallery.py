"""Build a visual index from the per-demo screenshots.

The root README is 165 rows of text with no pictures — you cannot tell what any
demo looks like without cloning the repo and installing Godot. This turns the
same index into a contact sheet, reusing the descriptions and categories that
are already there.

    tools/screenshots.sh          # capture docs/img/<demo>.png
    tools/build_gallery.py        # write docs/GALLERY.md

Demos without a screenshot are still listed, so a partial capture degrades to
the text index rather than silently dropping demos.

Every demo, with a frame captured from its actual running scene. Click a demo to

Screenshots are produced by `tools/screenshots.sh`, which runs each demo under a
virtual display and keeps one frame — so they show the real thing rather than
hand-picked marketing shots. A demo whose image is missing simply has not been
captured yet.

Looking for a route rather than a catalogue? See [learning paths](LEARNING_PATHS.md).
