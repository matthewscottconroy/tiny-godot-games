# Each demo gets two checks:
#
#   1. Smoke — actually boot the demo's main scene headless for a few frames and
#      fail on any script/scene error. The logic suites below construct their own
#      objects, so without this a demo whose scripts do not even parse can still
#      report a green suite. This is the check that covers the real scenes.
#
#   2. Logic — tests/test.tscn runs tests/test_logic.gd, which prints a
#      "[demo] N/M passed" summary line. A demo fails if N != M, if that line is
#      missing, or if Godot exits non-zero.
#
# Demos are independent projects, so both checks run concurrently across them.
