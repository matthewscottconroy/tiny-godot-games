# Shared memory safeguards for the tools that spawn Godot.
#
# Source this, do not run it:
#
#   source "$(dirname "$0")/memguard.sh"
#
# Why this exists: every tool here spawns Godot processes, and several of them
# spawn many at once. Godot peaks around 110MB resident per process, which is
# modest alone and is not modest multiplied by a core count. On a machine that
# is already busy — several editors, other agents, a browser — a run that scales
# purely on cores can push the box into swap or OOM. That happened repeatedly
# before these guards existed.
#
# Four separate protections, because any one of them alone leaves a hole:
#
#   1. Pre-flight    refuse to start when memory is already low
#   2. Bounded jobs  concurrency derived from free memory, not just cores
#   3. Live floor    abort mid-run if memory drops below a floor
#   4. Reaping       kill our own children on exit, interrupt, or abort
#
# Every threshold can be overridden by environment variable, because the right
# number depends on what else is running.

# Memory one Godot process is assumed to need. Measured peak RSS is ~107MB;
# 160 leaves headroom for a heavier demo without being wasteful.

# Absolute ceiling on concurrent Godot processes, whatever the maths says.
MEM_MAX_JOBS="${MEM_MAX_JOBS:-8}"

# Per-process address-space cap, in MB. A runaway allocation gets the process
# killed rather than the machine. Generous, because Godot maps far more virtual
# address space than it commits — too tight a value breaks normal operation.
